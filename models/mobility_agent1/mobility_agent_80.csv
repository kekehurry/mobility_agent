Walking is a common choice for short trips in urban areas like Cambridge, MA, especially for students. The availability of public transit is limited in this area, making walking or biking practical for short distances. However, the presence of private auto and auto passenger options suggests that car ownership is still a factor for some, especially for longer distances. The duration choices reflect typical travel times for these modes, with walking taking longer but being more affordable. Considering the context of a normal weekday, the choice of walking or biking for short trips is more likely, while private auto might be used for longer distances.""]","[{""primary_mode"": ""walking"", ""duration_minutes"": ""10-20"", ""weight"": 0.35}, {""primary_mode"": ""walking"", ""duration_minutes"": ""20-30"", ""weight"": 0.25}, {""primary_mode"": ""private_auto"", ""duration_minutes"": ""0-10"", ""weight"": 0.15}, {""primary_mode"": ""auto_passenger"", ""duration_minutes"": ""0-10"", ""weight"": 0.15}, {""primary_mode"": ""biking"", ""duration_minutes"": ""0-10"", ""weight"": 0.1}]"
