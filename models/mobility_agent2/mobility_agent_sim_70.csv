With no personal vehicle, public transit and walking are viable options. Cambridge has extensive public transit, making it a likely choice. Walking is common for short trips. On-demand auto services offer convenience but are less environmentally friendly. Auto passenger options might be available if someone else is driving. The duration choices reflect typical travel times for these modes in a city with good infrastructure.""]","[{""primary_mode"": ""public_transit"", ""duration_minutes"": ""10-20"", ""weight"": 0.35}, {""primary_mode"": ""walking"", ""duration_minutes"": ""10-20"", ""weight"": 0.25}, {""primary_mode"": ""on_demand_auto"", ""duration_minutes"": ""0-10"", ""weight"": 0.15}, {""primary_mode"": ""auto_passenger"", ""duration_minutes"": ""0-10"", ""weight"": 0.15}, {""primary_mode"": ""walking"", ""duration_minutes"": ""0-10"", ""weight"": 0.1}]"

The presence of multiple walking options suggests that for shorter distances, walking is a feasible and eco-friendly choice.
