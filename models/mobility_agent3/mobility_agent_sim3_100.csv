In Cambridge, MA, which has a robust public transit system and bike-friendly infrastructure, I would consider public transit and biking as viable options. However, with a household size of 2 and owning one vehicle, the likelihood of carpooling or using private auto is moderate. Given the time of day (18:00), evening commute traffic may affect travel time, making public transit or walking more appealing. The reference data shows a higher frequency of walking and public transit choices, suggesting that these modes are more commonly used by similar profiles in this area.""]","[{""primary_mode"": ""public_transit"", ""duration_minutes"": ""20-30"", ""weight"": 0.3}, {""primary_mode"": ""walking"", ""duration_minutes"": ""10-20"", ""weight"": 0.25}, {""primary_mode"": ""private_auto"", ""duration_minutes"": ""10-20"", ""weight"": 0.2}, {""primary_mode"": ""biking"", ""duration_minutes"": ""0-10"", ""weight"": 0.15}, {""primary_mode"": ""auto_passenger"", ""duration_minutes"": ""0-10"", ""weight"": 0.1}]"
