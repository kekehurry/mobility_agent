Cambridge, MA has good bike infrastructure and walkable neighborhoods, so walking or biking is feasible for short distances. However, since the target distance is unknown, I'll consider both short and longer trips. Private auto and auto passenger are viable for longer distances or when time is a priority. The duration choices vary, but I would prefer a balance between time and comfort.""]","[{""primary_mode"": ""walking"", ""duration_minutes"": ""10-20"", ""weight"": 0.15}, {""primary_mode"": ""walking"", ""duration_minutes"": ""20-30"", ""weight"": 0.1}, {""primary_mode"": ""walking"", ""duration_minutes"": ""30-40"", ""weight"": 0.05}, {""primary_mode"": ""private_auto"", ""duration_minutes"": ""10-20"", ""weight"": 0.25}, {""primary_mode"": ""private_auto"", ""duration_minutes"": ""20-30"", ""weight"": 0.15}, {""primary_mode"": ""auto_passenger"", ""duration_minutes"": ""0-10"", ""weight"": 0.1}, {""primary_mode"": ""biking"", ""duration_minutes"": ""0-10"", ""weight"": 0.1}, {""primary_mode"": ""biking"", ""duration_minutes"": ""10-20"", ""weight"": 0.05}, {""primary_mode"": ""biking"", ""duration_minutes"": ""20-30"", ""weight"": 0.05}]"
