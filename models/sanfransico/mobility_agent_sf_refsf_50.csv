Walking is a common choice for short trips, especially in a walkable city like San Francisco. However, due to age and potential physical limitations, longer walks may not be preferred. Private auto provides more comfort and control, which is especially important for someone with a lower income. Public transit is an option, but it may require navigating complex systems and can be less reliable for older individuals. Biking is less likely due to the age group and the city's infrastructure challenges. The duration for walking trips is typically shorter, while private auto trips can take longer due to traffic.
