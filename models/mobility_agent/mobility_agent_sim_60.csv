However, since I'm not in the labor force, I may not have the same need for efficiency as someone with a job. Walking is also a possibility if the destination is close, but I prefer to have the option to drive if needed. Cambridge, MA is a walkable city, but with a good public transit system, so I might consider both options. Since I'm under 18, I may not have a driver's license yet, which could influence my mode choice. However, the presence of two vehicles in the household might mean that someone else can drive me if needed. I'm also in the k_12 education stage, so school-related trips might influence my travel patterns. The duration choices suggest that most trips are short, so I would prioritize speed and convenience. In Cambridge, the availability of public transit and bike lanes makes biking a viable option. However, with a household size of 4, there might be shared trips, which could affect the mode choice. The income group is $100k-$150k, which is relatively high, so private auto or on-demand auto might be more common. But since I'm not in the labor force, I might not need to make daily commutes, which could influence the choice of mode. The employment status of not in the labor force means that I may not have a regular commute, so the choice might be more about convenience and accessibility rather than efficiency. The education level is k_12, so I might have school-related trips that could be done by walking or biking. Overall, the combination of income, household size, and education suggests that I might prefer private auto or public transit, but the exact choice depends on the destination and the availability of the mode. The reference data indicates that walking and public transit are common, so I might consider those as well. The presence of two vehicles suggests that private auto is a strong option. The on-demand auto and auto passenger options might be less likely since they are more for specific situations. The duration choices suggest that most trips are short, which aligns with walking or biking. However, with two vehicles, private auto is a viable option for longer distances. The cultural context of Cambridge, MA with its walkable streets and good public transit means that I might prefer walking or public transit for shorter distances, and private auto for longer distances. The combination of factors suggests that I would prioritize private auto for longer trips and public transit for shorter ones, but the exact choice depends on the specific trip and the availability of the mode.""]","[{""primary_mode"": ""private_auto"", ""duration_minutes"": ""0-10"", ""weight"": 0.3}, {""primary_mode"": ""public_transit"", ""duration_minutes"": ""0-10"", ""weight"": 0.25}, {""primary_mode"": ""walking"", ""duration_minutes"": ""0-10"", ""weight"": 0.2}, {""primary_mode"": ""biking"", ""duration_minutes"": ""0-10"", ""weight"": 0.15}, {""primary_mode"": ""private_auto"", ""duration_minutes"": ""10-20"", ""weight"": 0.1}]"

Biking is less common for this demographic due to weather and convenience. Public transit is reliable but might take longer.
