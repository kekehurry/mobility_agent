Cambridge, MA has a robust public transit system, making it feasible to use private auto less frequently. Given the household size, car ownership might be shared, reducing the need for personal vehicle use. Walking is common for short distances, but biking is also a viable option due to the city's bike-friendly infrastructure. However, without a vehicle, the primary mode would likely be walking or public transit. Since public transit isn't listed as an option, the available modes are walking, biking, or private auto (which might be used for longer trips). The duration choices reflect varying distances, with shorter durations indicating closer proximity. Given the profile, walking for short distances and biking for slightly longer trips are the most realistic choices.""]","[{""primary_mode"": ""walking"", ""duration_minutes"": ""0-10"", ""weight"": 0.35}, {""primary_mode"": ""walking"", ""duration_minutes"": ""10-20"", ""weight"": 0.25}, {""primary_mode"": ""walking"", ""duration_minutes"": ""20-30"", ""weight"": 0.15}, {""primary_mode"": ""biking"", ""duration_minutes"": ""0-10"", ""weight"": 0.15}, {""primary_mode"": ""biking"", ""duration_minutes"": ""10-20"", ""weight"": 0.1}, {""primary_mode"": ""private_auto"", ""duration_minutes"": ""0-10"", ""weight"": 0.0}]"
